9. When mysterySum(5) is called, the value 15 is returned. The recursive method presented sets two parameters in the form of
an if and an else statement. If n or the mysterySum is equal to zero, the method returns zero. If the mysterySum is equal to
or greater than 1, 3 is added to the returned value. Therefore, since the recursive method goes through five iterations when 
5 is inputed as the mysterySum, 3 is added to the returned value five times, returning 15.

11. When the program calls power3(15), 9 multiplications will be performed. In the recursive method presented, the value of 3^n 
is calculated. If power3 is 0 the method returns 1 because any number to the 0 power is 1. Otherwise, the power that 3 is raised
to is halved and 3 to that power is squared. If the halved power is odd, then the program multiplies the returned value by three.
However, to get to the 3^7 the program goes through 7 multiplications, making 9 in all.

18. To find the lighter coin among 81 coins if the rest are all the same weight takes 4 trials. The most efficient way to find 
the fake coin is by comparing three coins (if one is known to be the fake). If the compared coins from the group of three are
equal in weight, the third coin is fake. If the compared coins are not equal in weight, then the lighter one is fake. A recursive 
method where three groups are compared until only three coins (or the base case) remains can be used. Therefore, the given 
number of coins is split into three groups until only three coins remain. 81 can be split into groups of three 4 times, so the
number of trials is four.

What is a search function?
A search function is used when working with lists to find a specific target value. Two search algorithms include binary search 
and sequential search. Essentially, a search algorithm scans a list of values in order to find a specific value, and does so 
using an algorithm that is relevant and efficient.
