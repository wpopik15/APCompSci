6.a) 0
  b) 0
  c) 5.0
  d) 5.0
  e) 3
  
7.a) The value of balance is 105 because althought the rate is a double the balance is cast as type int.
  b) The value of gasMileage is 19.0 because gasMileage is declared as type double before it is calculated.
  
8. count += (total/pages - 5) * words - 1; I ran this in Eclipse w/ experimental values to check my solution.

9. Initially, the statement prints "The travel distance is 0.0," while it should be printing that the distance 
is 10082. The bug occurs because 1/2 is computed in int division and is truncated to 0, causing the statement 
to equal zero. The corrected line of code reads: System.out.println((double)1 / 2 * (g * t * t)); where 1/2
is cast as a type double before it is computed, returning the correct value.

12. The syntax error occurs because temp is never cast as a datatype. While both a and b are declared as type
doubles, temp is declared as type int. Therefore Eclipse throws the error "Type mismatch: cannot convert from
double to int." temp must be initially declared as type double rather than int for the code to compile. 

16. The code added into the BMI program is as follows:
 // Returns BMI equal to weight in kilograms divided
 // over squared height in meters.
  private double calculateBmi(int lbs, int inches){
	  double height;
	  double weight;
	  double kilogconvert = 0.454;
	  double meterconvert = 0.0254;
	  height = (inches * meterconvert);
	  weight = (lbs * kilogconvert);
	  return weight / (height * height);
  }
