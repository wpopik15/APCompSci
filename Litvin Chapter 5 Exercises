6. Eclipse gives the exception Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main

7. The parenthesese in the if statement are required by Java syntax. The braces are a matter of style, but improve readability.

8. The class compiles because there are no syntax errrors and the code is still valid. The message does not move across the screen
because the semicolon negates the if statement causing xPos to never reset.

9. Here is the restored code:
public boolean badIndentation(int maxLines) {
  int lineCount = 3;
  while (lineCount < maxLines) {
    System.out.println(lineCount);
    lineCount++;
  }
  return true;
}

11. 
a) The title bar is empty when the class runs because the title bar is never constructed
b) The window is left blank because the default constructor is used because void negates the HelloGui's constructor.

12. ??? explain in class ???

worked on with Mike Borghi and Michael Gates
