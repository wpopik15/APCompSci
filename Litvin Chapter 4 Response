  In Chapter 4, Livtin mentions that recursive solutions are less effective in run time and memory space in some cases when
compared to iterations. However, the hardware stack enables a recursive solution in file managing. Therefore, how does one
determine when a recursive solution is needed versus a iterations solution? Secondly, pseudocode is also mentioned early
on in the chapter. Does pseudocode have a rigid syntax structure like Java, and if so how does one begin to write in
pseudocode? More importantly, how does one translate pseudocode to Java and vice versa. Finally, if recursion is handled  
as a form of iterations by the computer program how can one be more effcient if both contain iterations?
