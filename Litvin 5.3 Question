  Rerserved words are specific words in Java of a given number that are 'reserved' for a 'special purpose' as opposed to other 
words that are simply random names assigned to objects, classes, and such by the coder. Reserved words are important to programs
for several reasons. Although they restrict the variety of names that a coder can assign to random variables, reserved words are 
only used in a certain way and have a certain meaning. Therefore, reserved words make programming a lot easier by giving 
programmers 'tools' to use to go about solving a certain problem. Reserved words show the coder and the reader that at that point
in the program there is a specific and known process occuring. For example, 'if' indicates that if a certain parameter is fulfilled
the program will do something. If the programmer had to code using phrases such as do this since this is true without reserved 
words, the starting point would be unclear. Therefore, essentially reserved words make up a large portion of the program.
  Syntax matters for very clear cut reasons. Java has a very rigid/strict syntax that is checked by the Java complier before the
program compiles. Syntax errors prevent compilation. In addition, Java has very little redunacy meaning that unless the strict
syntax rules are followed, the program will neither compile nor run. Style is irrevelvant in terms of the program compiling, but
is extremely important to the program. Source code must follow basic/generic Java stylistic tendencie. Source code today is 
very susceptible to edits and improvements. Therefore, if readability is low, the source code is basically useless. Readability 
allows changes to easily be made to the source code and serves the purpose of coding for the reader's sake, not the programmer's.
After all, the programmer should know what the code does; style helps to show the reader how the code works.
