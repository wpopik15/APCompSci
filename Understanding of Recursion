  Recursion is a form of iterations executed by the computer through functions calling themselves and is used to detail and 
execute algorithms. Recursive algorithms are where a procedure for a certain job is detailed relative to the same procedure 
applied to a smaller job. Recursive solutions must have a base case where recursion is not necessary. Finally, the stack 
storage mechanis, is used along with recursion in nested structures.
