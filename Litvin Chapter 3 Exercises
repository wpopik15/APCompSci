1.(a) False: The name of a class must be the same as the source file plus the extension .java preventing multiple classes in a folder.
  (b) True: The names of classes are case-sensitive due to convention in java. 
  (c) False: The import statement tells the compiler where to look for other classes used by this class.
4.(a) True: Public fields can be accessed and changed by other classes outside the program.
  (b) True: An object must be made using the new = operator when the program runs.
  (c) True: A class can have more than one object and each object has a least one constructor.
  (d) True: Like with GridWorl, the objects within the class must be defined (ex: Bug).
  (e) True: The init method is actually a constructor that runs before the program. 
5. Three benefits of encapsulation are program maintenance, documentation, and code reuse.
7. cannot get GridWorld to work
11. I have somewhat of an idea of what this asks for...
14.(a) True
   (b) False
16. I have not idea how to test these or predict errors.

NOTE: I will be completing this tomorrow after meeting now that I know that student files are avaialble online. 
CONSIDER THIS HW LATE--I WILL NOT BE TURNING IT IN 9/20--I WILL BE SEEKING HELP TO AVOID FUTURE DISASTER
